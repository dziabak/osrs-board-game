# RuneScape Kingdoms: Shadow of Elvarg - Music App

This project is live and you can find it here: [RuneScape Kingdoms: Shadow of Elvarg - Music App](https://runescape-kingdoms.netlify.app/)

## Overview
This is a very small and unpolished project I put together for the official RuneScape board game, *RuneScape Kingdoms: Shadow of Elvarg*.
The app works as a **sound board** for all of the locations and skills present in the game.

The project does not use any local files as it references the *OSRS Wiki* and its resources.

## Note
Due to issues with file formats of some of the files, not all of the sounds can be played on mobile. For the locations, they are marked with *(?)* symbol and as for the skills, unfortunately all sounds cannot be played on mobile browsers at the moment. To be able to play all of the sounds, please use the app on desktop browser.
